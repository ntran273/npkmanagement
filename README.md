# Project Scope

+ Project scope
++This application is a basketball team management site. The main features of this application consist of seeing game schedules, seeing players and their stats, and even the teams within the league -- simply keeping track of the players and their stats.

+ Project functionality
++This application has 3 types of user: the Observer, the Director, and the Exectutive Director.
++As an observer, you can see the front-end display of the application such as the stats, how many teams are in the leagues, etc. However, they cannot a player’s address for example. The observer sees the insensitive data, versus being able to see the sensitive data can only be seen by the admin.”  -- some of our use case questions consists of as a player can I view the team? If so how many games or what games can I see? What are the stats that I am able to view? 
++As a director, you can only see the View Team, View Stat, and View Games. The manager is also able to add players.” 
++As an executive director, you essentially have control over everything from viewing a team to removing players.
